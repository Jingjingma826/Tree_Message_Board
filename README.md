# Tree Message Board

Welcome to the Tree  Message Board! This web-based forum is designed to help homeowners resolve common disputes related to trees and hedges. Whether it's about overhanging branches, root damage, or blocked views, our platform offers a space for constructive discussions and advice from fellow tree enthusiasts.

## Project Overview

The Tree Message Board is a web application that allows users to:

- Register and Log In/Out: Create an account, log in, log out and manage your profile.
- Post and delete Messages: Share issues or questions about trees and hedges with the community.
- Reply to Messages: Engage in conversations and provide or receive advice.
- Role-Based Access Control: Different roles (Admins, Moderators, Members) with specific permissions to manage content and users.


## Features

Hashing password: All of the passwords have to be hashed when new users register to be a member.

#### User Roles:
There are three user roles in this system:

- Administrator: Can view all users profile, manage all usersâ€™ status and roles, and moderate messages and replies.
- Moderator: Can moderate messages and replies, and assist with managing discussions , updating their own profile.
- Member: Can update their own profile, post and delete their own messages, reply to others, and manage their own profile.
- Session Handling: Secure login and logout functionality, ensuring that users' sessions are managed properly.
- Access Control: Role-based permissions to ensure appropriate access levels and actions for different types of users.
- Message Posting and Replying: Users can post new messages, reply to existing ones, and participate in community discussions.

Anyone who registers via the app will be a **Member**. The only way to create
**Staff** or **Admin** accounts in this simple app is to insert them directly
into the database.

## Getting this Example Running

To run the example yourself, you'll need to:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Create yourself a virtual environment.
3. Install all of the packages listed in requirements.txt (Visual Studio will
   offer to do this for you during step 2).
4. Use the [Database Creation Script](<Create Database.sql>) to create your own
   copy of the **loginexample** database.
5. Use the [Database Population Script](<Populate Database.sql>) to populate
   the **tree_message_board** ***users*** table with example users.
6. Modify [connect.py](treeapp/connect.py) with the connection details for
   your local database server.
7. Run [The Python/Flask application](run.py).

At that point, you should be able to register yourself a new **user** account
or log in using one of the **user**, **staff**, or **admin** accounts listed in
the [Database Population Script](<Populate Database.sql>).

Enjoy!
